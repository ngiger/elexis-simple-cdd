h1. Create CD for bootstrapping an Elexis server

Here you find several rake tasks to create ISO-images for
a Elexis server

The CD will contains Debian squeeze with some initial
packages used for bootstrapping via puppet.

The initial configuration comes from a client (e.g.
a general practioner) specific git repository which 
contains definitions for the different nodes (virtual
machine, client PCs, thin clients, etc).

It will reference via git submodules a number of puppet
modules.

To use it do the following.

# clone this repository
# create a client configuration or clone the elexis-demo-servet
# @rake puppet_vm['../path/to/client_config_repository']@

Wait a few minutes and you will have a CD ready to install.

Once you have, copy it to your archivista VM-server, e.g.
@scp images/debian-unstable-i386-CD-1.iso root@avvm:/var/lib/vz/template/iso/@

Now we are ready to create the templates for the various possible
VM-machines. We need to ssh into the avvm  and execute the following command:
scp gen_elexis_vm.sh root@avvm:
ssh root@avvm bash ./gen_elexis_vm.sh

h2. Customization

Have a look at the rakefile and puppet_vm.rb to adapt
some global variables (e.g. proxy servers) to you needs.
